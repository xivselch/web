Emet-Selch ("we", "us", or "our") is committed to safeguarding your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of data we collect, how we use it, and the measures in place to protect it when you interact with our Final Fantasy XIV (FFXIV) companion website, whether as a logged-in or anonymous user.

## 1. Information We Collect

### Discord Authentication

When you log in using Discord, we collect only your **Discord User ID**, which is used internally to associate your account with character data. Authentication is managed via a secure, self-hosted instance of an open-source authentication framework. We do not collect any additional information from your Discord account.

While we may display your Discord avatar and username within the application interface, this is handled entirely within your browser and is not stored or transmitted to our servers.

### Public FFXIV Character Data

We collect publicly available FFXIV character information from sources such as the Lodestone and third-party services like FFXIVCollect. This includes character names, home worlds, job levels, portraits, equipment, and other details already accessible via public web APIs.

### Cookies and Browser Storage

We use cookies and browser-based storage mechanisms (e.g., `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`) to support both logged-in and anonymous sessions. These are used to preserve user preferences, including selected characters, custom deliveries, and society ranks.

For users who do not log in, no data is sent to our servers. All preferences remain stored locally on your device and are retained until manually cleared.

## 2. Use of Information

Your data is used exclusively to enable core application features, including:

- Logging in and authenticating via Discord
- Associating Discord accounts with FFXIV characters
- Displaying character data within the user interface
- Storing character preferences and custom settings
- Maintaining persistent user sessions

We do **not** use your data for advertising or behavioral tracking. Limited, anonymized usage data may be collected to help us improve performance, compatibility, and user experience. Your information is never sold, rented, or shared with third parties.

## 3. Data Storage and Security

If you log in, we store only your Discord User ID and the FFXIV characters linked to it. This association is used to provide account-specific features. Character data is periodically refreshed from public sources to ensure accuracy.

We do not store IP addresses, Discord tokens, or any personally identifiable information beyond the User ID. All data is stored securely, with access restricted to the development team.

## 4. Anonymous Usage

You are not required to log in to use the application. When using the site anonymously, your preferences—such as character selections and delivery progress—are stored locally in your browser. This data is never transmitted to our servers and is not accessible by us.

Please note that local data may be lost if you clear your browser storage or use a different device or browser.

## 5. Data Deletion and User Rights

You retain full control over your data:

- You may link or unlink characters at any time through the application interface.
- You may request the deletion of your stored data, including your Discord User ID and any associated character links.

Following deletion, character data may still exist on public sources such as the Lodestone, but the connection to your Discord account will be removed.

Data deletion requests can be submitted directly through the application or by contacting us.

## 6. Third-Party Services

This application interacts with the following external services:

- **Discord** – Used for authentication via OAuth2
- **Lodestone** and **FFXIVCollect** – Used to retrieve publicly available FFXIV character data

Authentication is handled through a secure, self-hosted framework that does not collect or transmit any additional personal information beyond what is described in this policy.

We do not transmit or share your data with any third parties beyond the services listed above.

## 7. Children’s Privacy

This application is not intended for individuals under the age of 13. In accordance with the terms of both Discord and FFXIV, children under this age are not permitted to use those platforms. We do not knowingly collect personal data from anyone under 13 years of age. If you believe a child has accessed the site and provided information inappropriately, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.

## 8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When changes are made, the "Last updated" date at the top of this document will be revised. We encourage users to review this policy periodically to stay informed about how their data is handled.
