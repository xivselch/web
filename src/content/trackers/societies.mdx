Allied Society Quests — formerly known as Beast Tribe Quests before Patch 6.1 and Tribal Quests prior to Patch 7.0 — are intersocial missions offered by various allied groups throughout Eorzea and beyond.

You can complete up to **12 quests per day**, with a maximum of **3 quests per society**, regardless of rank. In _A Realm Reborn_, quests are offered by multiple NPCs per society, allowing **3 quests per NPC** instead.

        The Ixali quests are primarily **crafting-based** and require a **Disciple of the Hand** to undertake. Some higher-rank quests may also include gathering or light combat steps in addition to crafting.
