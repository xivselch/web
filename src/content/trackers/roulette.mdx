Duty Roulettes are randomized daily dungeon activities that match you into eligible duties based on your selected role. They offer bonus rewards for first-time completions each day, including gil, experience, and tomestones.

You can complete each roulette category once per day for its bonus. Popular categories include **Leveling**, **Expert**, **Alliance Raids**, and **Mentor**. Some roulettes have specific unlock requirements or role restrictions.

        Queueing as a tank or healer often results in much faster duty finder times &mdash; plus you'll get **Adventurer in Need** bonuses if your role is in demand.

        Most roulettes require **minimum item level** and completion of specific main scenario or side content. Make sure to unlock them via the Duty Finder and related questlines.
